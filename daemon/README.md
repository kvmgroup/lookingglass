# daemon

This is the LookingGlass Daemon, it is the actual software that runs the tests sent from the main web interface. 

For the daemon to work correctly you must install it's dependencies like so:

```
apt-get install mtr
apt-get install traceroute
```

By default ping & ping6 will be included on ubuntu.
